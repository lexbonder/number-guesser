# Number Guesser - Alex Bonder - (FE Module 1)

This is the first project assigned to us at Turing. It is a JavaScript based number guessing game. The focus on this project was to introduce us to DOM manipulation, recieving inputs from a user, and giving the user different responses based on the input. We also needed to make sure our implementation matched the comp as shown in the spec

The features in this game I'm most proud of are the jumbling numbers on the welcome screen and the dynamic start button that changes based on the user's input when they set parameters for the game.
